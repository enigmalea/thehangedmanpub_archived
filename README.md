The Hanged Man is a fan collaborative for fans of Bioware's video game series
Dragon Age. Our primary goals include: creating spaces for fans to interact with
other fans in positive and meaningful ways, hosting events which encourage
creation of fanworks to keep fans engaged with Dragon Age fandom, and promoting
Dragon Age events (or multi-fandom events which fit DA themes) which may
interest DA fans.
