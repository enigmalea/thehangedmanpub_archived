# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members and moderators pledge to make participation in our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible
or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission

## Our Beliefs and Values

Central to our Code of Conduct are the below beliefs and values which inform the
more specific rule sets of our communities and events, how we interact with one
another as members, and how moderators interact with members. Although you do
not have to agree with each of the below items to be an active member of our
communities, we do ask that you keep these in mind before choosing to join or
participate. Conduct which is in conflict with the below beliefs and values will
result in moderator actions up to and including removal from the community or
event.

- We believe all fans have a right to space in the fandom.

  This is not a blanket "you can continue to remain here and be a jerk"
  statement. What this does mean is that we do our best not to let our personal
  feelings color our judgment of others. If we don't like you or your headcanons
  or your ships, you are still welcome in our communities and events as long as
  you can follow the rules and get along with others.

  We do not tolerate drama for the sake of drama, hate speech, or harassment.
  Once your existence in a space becomes hostile and makes the space toxic and
  unbearable for others, you lose your right to remain.

- We believe in supporting creativity, diversity, and inclusion in fanworks.

  What it says on the tin, really. We think all fan creators should be
  encouraged to create. Part of the fun of fandom is engaging with one another's
  works, encouraging others, and supporting diverse creators. This includes
  lesser celebrated and non-traditional types of fanworks like meta posts,
  playlists, manips/edits, layouts, etc!

- We believe in adults' right to sexual expression.

  Dragon Age is a rated mature dark fantasy RPG which is intended for adults.
  Therefore, most of our spaces are 18+. This means that we support, share, and
  discuss NSFW content even if that content is what others would deem
  "problematic".

  We do not believe in or support kinkshaming.

  With a few exceptions (primarily in our exchanges on AO3), we usually allow
  all content which is allowable on the platform where are our communities or
  events are hosted.

- We believe in respecting peoples triggers and squicks.

  Although we do allow all content, we absolutely believe in tagging content
  that could be potentially triggering or squicky. We believe our members should
  respect one another's requests for hiding text and images/tagging/warnings. If
  someone is asking for a tag or spoiler, there's usually a reason.

  Our communities do have varying rules about using spoiler settings for
  _general_ NSFW content or where that can be posted, so please be sure to read
  carefully!

- We believe in valuing de-escalation, good faith interpretations, and talking
  through miscommunication.

  Since we operate in fandom, a large percentage of us are neurodivergent which
  can sometimes pose communication difficulties. Our main rules when approaching
  communication is to approach most situations assuming that no one is
  intentionally trying to hurt someone and to attempt to de-escalate (even if
  that means walking away from a situation until you are calm). When
  mis-communications occur, we believe in talking through them so that we all
  understand one another's viewpoints.

- We believe in second chances and the right to grow.

  Barring examples of egregious past actions, we let individuals' current
  actions speak for themselves. This is fandom and we know that falling outs and
  grudges happen. We do not usually remove people from our communities based
  solely on hearsay from others, even with screenshots of past wrongdoing.
  Exceptions for this include:

  - Recent hate speech, death threats, etc
  - An ongoing pattern of abusive/harassing/toxic behavior
  - Past or current participation in call-outs, public shaming, or dogpiling of
    a current member of our communities who is in good standing.

  The above exceptions are in no way exhaustive.

  Ultimately, someone who is claiming they are changing their past ways should
  convince us they are sincere and making an effort through their current
  actions in and outside of our communities and events.

- We DO NOT believe in call-outs, public shaming, dogpiling, suicide bating,
  death threats, or other harassment techniques.

  Full stop. No one who participates in these kinds of behaviors is welcome in
  our events, projects, or communities. We do not police member behaviors
  outside of our spaces, but if we are made aware of these actions members will
  be removed.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all communities and events under The Hanged
Man umbrella. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the
The Hanged Man in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include
posting via moderator accounts, official social media accounts, or sending
emails using official moderator email addresses.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, posts, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of
Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the moderators of the community or event in question. Please see
individual communities or events for contact methods. Alternatively, you may
also email [enigmalea@gmail.com](mailto:enigmalea@gmail.com) directly.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

Moderators who violate the code of conduct may face temporary or permanent
repercussions as determined by other moderators, up to and including their
status as moderators.

## Updates and Changes

We recognize our Code will not cover every possible circumstance, and that our
needs as a community may change depending on our make-up. Our Code is intended
to be a broadly stated guideline for our function as a community and not a
play-by-play guide for moderation or member behavior within the community. As
such, this Code of Conduct is considered a living document which may be
modified, updated, and clarified over time. Changes and updates to our Code of
Conduct will be announced in the communities and events which are impacted by
them.
