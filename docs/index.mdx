The Hanged Man began on a whim on July 13, 2019, when the founder, enigmalea
decided they wanted to have a place to talk about Dragon Age fanfiction on
Discord - writing, reading, and betaing it. They had a vague concept of the type
of community they wanted to create, and they got to work on writing rules,
establishing a few channels, and organizing the server. The first invite code
was shared a week later. Since the server first opened, The Hanged Man's founder
and mods have hosted fandom events and projects and expanded to other social
media sites.

As The Hanged Man's reach expands, we hope to transform into a "fan
organization" - a collective of Dragon Age fans who try to make a positive
difference in the fandom community by giving fans a place to chat, share and
create content, and interact.

## Our Goals

### Long-term Goals

- Creating spaces for fans to interact with other fans in positive and
  meaningful ways
- Hosting events which encourage creation of fanworks to keep fans engaged with
  Dragon Age fandom
- Promoting Dragon Age events (or multi-fandom events which fit DA themes) which
  may interest DA fans

### 2023 Goals

- Establishing The Hanged Man "brand".

  This year our focus will be on defining our core values and code of
  conduct, and establishing the principals that will guide the collective
  moving forward. Our goal isn't to make something marketable or profitable (we
  are a fan organization after all!), but rather to work to create an "identity"
  for the club that could potentially guide future fans who may want to help out
  or even take over the organization.

- Bringing our other projects into The Hanged Man "brand".

  Every event we run and community we have is guided by the same general
  principals and rule set. Although some of these began as off-shoots of The
  Hanged Man Discord server, some of them have (so far) been kept separate. We'd
  like to unite them so that there is one vision moving forward.

  Events like DA Polyshipping and Arlathan eXchange will continue to have their
  own servers, websites, etc, and fans are welcome to participate in these as
  much or little as they like. The goal with unification is to simplify certain
  types of announcements and communications and to provide a single site where
  you can find all of our projects, events, and social media communities.

- Establishing an active presence on tumblr, pillowfort, and dreamwidth.

  We have had accounts on tumblr and pillowfort for years, but have been remiss
  in using them. Our focus for 2023 will on making sure we use our accounts to
  give fans who aren't interested in Discord a place to interact with the fandom
  in a positive way.
