# Question of the Day

In the **Discord Server**, we have a Question of the Day which posts daily for
our members to answer. Topics range from general writing questions to DA lore to
to character development questions about original characters and even playlists!
We have several questions which repeat on a schedule.

The QOTD began in March 2020 and has continued faithfully since. Over time the
system we use to manage our QOTD has evolved from a manual bot code prone to
human error to a database system... that still has human error, but less of it.

We gladly welcome question submissions!

## Monthly Prompt

On the first of each month, we prompt the server with a word prompt. The prompts
are generic enough they can be used for either art or writing. Prompt
completions can be shared throughout the month and members are welcome to
showcase wips and chat about their prompt answers. Prompts can be filled at any
point throughout the month (and beyond!)

## Picrew Day

On the second of each month, we share a picrew or other dollmaker and encourage
our members to create their OC/MC/PC in the picrew.

## Screenshot Day

We ask members to share screenshots from playthroughs on the 10th of each month.

## Theme Week

The third week of month is dedicated to one theme per day. The themes are:

- **Six Sentence/Six Minute Monday**<br />
Writers share six sentences from a WIP or
  artists share six minutes of progress on a wip with a before and after.
- **Monday Musings**<br />
A focus on sharing and talking about headcanons!
- **Turmoil Tuesday**<br />
A focus on angsty fics, wips, and art.
- **WIP Wednesday**<br />
Share an update on your wip!
- **Thirsty Thursday**<br />
A focus on thirsty and smutty fics, wips, and art.
- **Fic Rec Friday**<br />
Rec a fic not by you!
- **Soft Saturday**<br />
A focus on fluffy fics, wips, and art.

We welcome our members to share their themed answers outside of the server on
social media and have banners they can use for that purpose.
