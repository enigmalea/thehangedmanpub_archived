# Fic Club

The Hanged Man's **Fic Club** is an event run on Discord and mirrored on the
Dreamwidth and Pillowfort accounts. The goals for the fic club is to read more
fic _and_ kudos and/or comment on more fic. The goal is approximately 7k - 10k
per month. <span className="inlineNote">This goal may be increased or decreased,
based on member feedback.</span>

Participation in fic club is voluntary, and members are free to join and leave
the club as their time allows. However, if a member does participate, there are
a few guidelines for participation.

## General Guidelines

- Fic Club will read between 7k and 10k per
  month.<br /><span className="subNote">This can be accomplished by splitting a
  longer fic into shorter bits, adding up shorter fics to hit the goal, OR by
  choosing one single fic that hits this word count.</span>
- Fic Club members work together to suggest and choose
  fics.<br /><span className="subNote">Facilitators are only here to help keep
  to the schedule and announce discussions.</span>
- Fic Club will have a discussion about the fic _at minimum_ twice per
  month.<br /><span className="subNote">This schedule is flexible based on word
  count and the number of fics being read. For example, if we're reading four
  fics, a weekly discussion might be appropriate. For longer fics, the first
  discussion acts as a check-in for the halfway point and a cheer-on to help you
  finish.</span>
- We recognize that not all fics will be to everyone's taste, and highly
  encourage other members to run alternate fic club
  selections.<br /><span className="subNote">For example, if we're reading a
  ship you do not like, you're more than welcome to gather a group of people who
  would be more interested in alternate fics. See
  [Alternate Selections](#alternate-selections) for more info.</span>

## Participation Guidelines

1. The first rule of fic club is: don't talk about fic
   club.<br /><span className="subNote">Just kidding, tell your friends. Talk
   about fic club. You can even tell the authors you read the fic because of fic
   club. We don't care.</span>
2. Participation means you agree to read the fic(s) chosen and leave a kudos or
   comment.
3. Comments can be left after group
   discussion!<br /><span className="subNote">One of the goals of this is to
   make commenting easier through discussion between participants.</span>
4. You should have completed your reading by the discussion days (or shortly
   after) and be ready to discuss the fic.
5. Participation in discussions is the
   point!<br /><span className="subNote">Even if you can't be there at the
   _exact_ time a discussion starts, please join in asynchronously in the
   discussion at your leisure! Fic Club won't work without the
   discussion!</span>

## How Fics Are Chosen

- Members complete a form to suggest fics. The form is open at all times.

  - Fics should be in the Dragon Age fandom.
  - Fics should be hosted on AO3.
  - Fics should be _complete_ at the time they are suggested.
  - At this time, fics should be under 20k. If there is enough interest and
    participation, we may run sessions for novel-length and epic-length fics in
    the future!
  - Members should _not_ recommend their own
    fics.<br /><span className="inlineNote">This is based on the honor system.
    Members may suggest other members' fics!</span>

- Mods will select select 3-4 fics or fic groups for the next month, and post a
  poll for members of the Discord to vote on.

  - In order to keep fic choice simplified and not have to aggregate votes
    across platforms, only the Discord will be allowed to vote on fic choices.
    If you would like to vote, please join!

- Once the selection is made, the fic(s) and reading schedule, as well as
  discussion dates, will be announced on Discord, Pillowfort, and Dreamwidth.
  Any members of these communities are welcome to join in!

## Discussion Guidelines

### On the Discord:

- Discussion threads will be created off the channel most closely related to the
  fic.
- Each fic will get its own thread.
- The `@fic club` role will be pinged in the `wicked_grace` channel with a link
  to the thread when it's time for discussion to begin.
- Participants can join in at their leisure to discuss the fic.

### On Pillowfort and Dreamwidth:

- Threads will be created in the announcement of the fics for each discussion
  date.
- Threads will be frozen when it's time for the next discussion.
- Threads will be unfrozen at the end of the month, so people can continue to
  comment/discuss and so people who stumble on fic club later can also read the
  fics and discuss!

## Alternate Selections

If the group chosen fics contain ratings, tropes, or ships you don't or can't
read, we welcome you to host an alternate selection. Discussions on alternate
selections should happen at the same time as other selections. For an alternate
selection, we recommend:

- Posting to ask if others would be interested in an alternate
  selection.<br /><span className="inlineNote">If there are not more than three
  people interested, it may be better for you to skip the fic, rather than host
  an alternate selection.</span>
- Posting a poll to choose between three or more fics for a group consensus.
- Hosting a thread on the Discord in the manner listed above for
  discussion.<br /><span className="inlineNote">We don't forsee alternate
  selections being on Pillowfort or Dreamwidth; however, if there is interest,
  in alternate selections being hosted by someone on the Discord without an
  account on pillowfort or Dreamwidth, we will be happy to post threads for
  discussions on those platforms.</span>

Mods are happy to help talk you through technical things, but **will not** post
the polls or create threads for you. This is an opportunity for you to learn how
to post polls and start threads!
